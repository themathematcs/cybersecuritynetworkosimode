        <h1>What is OSI Model</h1>
    <p>OSI (Open systems interconnect) is a reference model that depicts data communication over a network. It was created based on a proposal from International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Its official title is ISO OSI Reference Model because it relates to or describes systems that are available for communication with other devices. It also defines standards for:
<br>
    Communication between devices.  <br>
Means to inform devices about when to transmit/ not transmit the data. <br>
Methods that ensure accurate data flow rate to devices. <br>
Methods that ensure the data is received by the intended recipient. <br>
Arrangement and connection of physical transmission media. <br>
It divides the computer network architecture into seven (7) layers of logical progression. Lower layers perform functions like routing of binary data and handling electrical signals. Issues such as network request and response, data representation and network protocols are handles by the higher levels of the model.

            Characteristics of Seven Layers in OSI Model</h1>
            Layer wise characteristics of OSI model are as follows :
           <br> <br>
            1. Physical Layer in OSI Model <br>
            Physical layer of the OSI model has the following characteristics:
            <br>
            <br>
            Deals with transmitting raw bits of data over a physical medium. <br>
            It is hardware specific and is responsible for actual physical connection between a network medium and your computer.
            <br>
            <br>
            Data is handled in the form of 1s and 0s. These are represented by light pulses, electric voltages or radio frequencies.
           <br> All devices functioning at this layer handle signaling.
           <br> Ethernet cables, Token ring networks , pin-outs, cable types, connectors are some of the components included in this layer. <br>

2. Data Link Layer in OSI Model
Data link layer of OSI model has the following characteristics :

Enables data movement over a link from one device to another
Media access control.
Packet addressing.
Formatting the frame that is used to encapsulate data.
Error notification on physical layer.
It orders bits and packets to and from data segments. This ensuing result is called as frames. They contain data that are set in an orderly manner.
Ensure error-free communication between two devices by correct transmission of frames.
Data Link Layer is further divided into 2 components. They are termed as Media Access Control (MAC) and Logical Link Control (LLC) respectively. This division is mainly attributed to the complex structure of data link layer.

    3. Network Layer in OSI Model
Network layer of OSI model has the following characteristics:

Responsible for establishing paths that are used for the transfer of data packets between network devices.
Traffic direction.
Addressing; Service and logical network addresses.
Routing.
Packet switching.
Controlling packet sequence.
Complete error detection; from sender to receiver.
Congestion control.
Gateway services.

4. Transport Layer in OSI Model
Transport layer in OSI-model has the following characteristics:

Responsible for message delivery between the networked hosts. Messages are fragmented and reassembled by this layer. It also controls the reliability of any given link.
Guaranteed delivery of data.
Name resolution.
Flow control.
Error detection and recovery.
TCP and UDP are the common transport protocols used at this layer.

5. Session Layer in OSI Model
Session layer of the OSI-model has the following characteristics:

Establish, monitor and terminate the communication session between applications.
Name lookup, security functions and data synchronization.
Placement of header information in a packet.
Determines whether the messages that are exchanged during a session are full or half duplex.
